Through this binder, you'll be able to see the techniques using a CMIP6 climate model (MIROC6) used to compute ENSO indices, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscilation, teleconnections. Also some usefull technique like regridding, Empirical Orthogonal Functions, filters, detrending and all the basic xarray methods (selection, resampling, plotting, masks, ...)

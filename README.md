Through this binder, you'll be able to see the techniques used to compute ENSO indices, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscilation, teleconnections using a CMIP6 climate model (MIROC6). Also some usefull techniques like regridding, Empirical Orthogonal Functions, filters, detrending and all the basic xarray methods (selection, resampling, plotting, masks, ...)

Enjoy,
